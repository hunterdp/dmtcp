# **Acknowledging DMTCP in Academic Papers**

We encourage contributors and others to publish papers and offer a method to consistently contribute the project.  
On one hand, the primary focus of Project DMTCP is on producing open-source software. We are very much focused on writing code that delights our users. On the other hand, DMTCP emerged out of an academic setting, where research and peer-reviwed publications are a primary focus. To this day, many of our core contributors have academic positions and active research programs.  This emphasis is also reflected in the usage of DMTCP across areas of scientific research. Thus, in spite of a focus on writing software for users, DMTCP remains a tool that is by and for researchers.

Given this focus on research, the ongoing academic careers of DMTCP contributors, and our desire to have an impact on computing research, it is important for us to author and publish peer-reviewed papers on DMTCP itself.  Authoring these papers in the context of an open-source community presents a number of differences compared to many research collaborations.

## Principles

We have tried to create a process for authoring papers with the following general principles in mind:

* **Inclusivity and generosity in authorship.** Multiple individuals have contributed to the different DMTCP subprojects. These contributions span code, design, documentation, discussions, giving talks/tutorials, etc. We want to be generous in extending authorship privileges and responsibilities to as many of these contributors as possible.
  
* **Clear, explicit criteria for authorship.** While being generous, we want have concrete, specific and auditable criteria for including individuals as authors.

* **Openness.** The process of authoring papers should be open in the same way as the rest of the project's work. Thus, all of our papers are written in the public on GitHub.

* **Accountability.** Being an author on a paper is a privilege, but also involves responsibilities. The concrete processes described below elucidate these responsibilities.

We expect to author and submit papers to different types of journals. Different journals will have slightly different concrete processes that appropriately embody these principles.

## Project Citiation Recommendation

As DMTCP is free software and is used in many areas of reseach, we would recommend the following citations if required.

Alternatively, adding the Project DMTCP in the standard ackowledgement section of the paper.  We recommend the following sentenance:
