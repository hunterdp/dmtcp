# Governance of the DMTCP Project
The official version of this documentis contained in The Project Governance Repository at: [https://github.com/dmtcp/governance](../governance.md)

## Governance

The project is governed by a ***Steering Council*** with a ***Chairperson***, who has the additional ability to cast a veto vote.   The members of the Steering Council are those contributors whose active and consistent contributions have been recognized by their receiving *commit rights* to the Project GitHub repositories. In general all Project decisions are made through consensus and voting among the Council with input from the Community.

## Steering Council

The Steering Council (Council) is ultimately responsible for all dimensions of the Project (including, but not limited to, software, legal, financial, community, operations, inclusion and diversity, etc.). The members of the Council actively work to carry out the Project's mission in accordance with its values and to support operations.  The Steering Council is charged with:

-   Make decisions about the overall scope, vision, and direction of the project.
-   Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or individuals.
-   Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and pull requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code review process and merging pull requests.
-   Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and manage those Services for the benefit of the Project and Community.

The Project's Chairperson is currently [Gene Cooperman](mailto:g.cooperman@northeastern.edu) and the initial members are: 
- Kapil Arya (@karya0)
- Rohan Garg (@rohgarg)
- Twinkle Jain (@JainTwinkle)
- Yue Li (@yuelimv)
- Dahong Li (@dahongli)

## Decision-making and voting procedures

The Council will make decisions using consensus seeking with an option to call a vote to move the decision forward. 

* *Informal consensus seeking.* Decision making starts with informal consensus seeking through discussion. The goal of this phase is to refine the proposal, consider alternatives, weigh trade-offs, and attempt to find informal consensus. The legitimacy of the consensus-seeking process is predicated on all stakeholders having their voices heard, so councils must be proactive in providing opportunities for all relevant stakeholders to provide input. If the council arrives at informal consensus, they may immediately move to document and enact the decision. 
* *Calling a vote.* Any member of the Council can call the matter to a vote. When that member calls the proposal to a vote, they shall summarize the proposal in its current form for the entire Council. After the proposal is seconded by another member of the council, members have seven days to vote. The council may consider longer voting periods as necessary for special circumstances, or _shorter periods only if all voting members are present_. The decision will be determined by a simple majority of non-blank votes for binary decisions (i.e., approving a proposal) and ranked choice for multi-class decisions (one among many, or several among many). The sponsor may update the proposal at any point during the voting period, in which case the voting period will be reset.
* *Voter participation and quorum.* All members of the Council are required to participate in at least 2/3 of formal votes per calendar year. The quorum for all formal votes will be 50% and a "blank" option will always be included, with the "blank" option counting towards the quorum but not included in totals for calculating results.
* *Recording.* Once a decision has been made during the consensus-seeking phase or by a formal vote, the council will record the decision, e.g., in Team Compass issues for councils whose workflow is on GitHub or other equivalent and publicly visible mechanisms. 

## Conflict of Interest

It is expected that the Chairperson and Steering Council Members will be employed at a wide range of companies, universities, and non-profit organizations. Because of this, it is possible that Members will have conflict of interests. Such conflict of interests includes, but are not limited to:

-   Financial interests, such as investments, employment, or contracting work, outside of The Project that may influence their work on The Project.
-   Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially leak into their work with the Project.
-   An issue where the person privately gains an advantage from The Project resources, but The Project has no gain or suffers a disadvantage.

All members of the Council shall disclose to the rest of the Council any conflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of interest in a particular issue may participate in Council discussions on that issue but must recuse themselves from voting on the issue.   

## Adding and Removing Executive Council Members

* Any member of the Executive Council may recommend an additional member who will present the nominee and rationale for adding the member to the Council.   New members will be added by a majority vote of existing Council members.  The removal of a Council member will follow the same process.  The Chairperson retains the veto vote for these matters.
* Council members can voluntarily resign at anytime and will be listed on the project website, acknowledging the period during which they were active in the Council.  
* The Council reserves the right to eject current Members, other than the Chairperson, if they are deemed to be actively harmful to the projectâ€™s well-being, and attempts at communication and conflict resolution have failed. 
* When/if the Chairperson decides to resign, he/she decide if a new Chairperson will be elected by majorty vote of the Council, or the position of Chairperson will no longer exist.

## Subprojects

Software Subprojects in the DMTCP community are official areas of focus and effort within the DMTCP ecosystem. They often map to a single GitHub organization. Subprojects must abide by the Code of Conduct, decision-making and governance processes stated above.

## Changing the Governance Documents

Changes to the governance documents are submitted via a GitHub pull request to The Project's governance documents GitHub repository at [https://github.com/dmtcp/governance](../governance).  There are two phases to the process:

- *The discussion phase* begins when the person first opens a pull-request. During this time, *the pull-request must be in a draft state*. The pull request is refined in response to community comment and review by the Council, with the goal being consensus in the Council.  The pull request author may *call a vote* when they believe enough feedback and iteration has occurred. This is triggered by moving the pull request from the *draft state* to an *active state*. This triggers the voting phase. 
- *The voting phase* begins when the PR enters an active state. The proposed changes in the pull request are frozen and may not be substantively modified after voting has begun. During the voting phase, the Steering Council votes on whether the changes are ratified, and the pull request merged (accepting the proposed changes) or that the pull request be closed without merging (rejecting the proposed changes).

All votes are limited in time to 4 weeks after the voting phase begins. At the end of 4 weeks, the proposal passes if 2/3 of the votes are in favor; otherwise, the proposal is rejected and the PR is closed. Prior to the four-week limit, if at least 80% of the Steering Council has voted and 2/3 of the votes are in favor, the proposal passes. Since the Chairperson holds a veto vote in The Project, he/she has authority to act alone in accepting or rejecting changes or overriding Steering Council decisions.
